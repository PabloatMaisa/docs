# Learn About KPU

Maisa is proud to introduce the **KPU (Knowledge Processing Unit)** — a groundbreaking framework designed to overcome the limitations of traditional large language models (LLMs). By decoupling reasoning and data processing, the KPU redefines how AI tackles complex tasks.

## Why KPU?

LLMs like GPT-4 have revolutionized AI, but they face persistent challenges:

- **Hallucinations**: LLMs may generate inaccurate information due to their predictive token-based nature.
- **Context Limitations**: Processing large sequences of information often leads to inefficiency or critical data being overlooked.
- **Outdated Knowledge**: Pre-training limits models to information available up to a certain date.
- **Digital Interaction Constraints**: LLMs struggle to connect with external systems like APIs and databases.

KPU addresses these challenges by creating a system optimized for reliable, scalable, and precise task-solving.

## How KPU Works

The KPU architecture integrates three key components:

1. **Reasoning Engine**  
   Acts as the system's "brain," orchestrating task-solving with step-by-step plans using LLMs and external tools.

2. **Execution Engine**  
   Executes commands from the Reasoning Engine, processes the data, and sends feedback for iterative improvements.

3. **Virtual Context Window**  
   Separates reasoning and data processing, ensuring LLMs focus on logical reasoning while other components manage data-intensive tasks.

This design is inspired by operating systems, efficiently managing resources to provide users with seamless task execution.

## KPU in Action

KPU has already demonstrated its capabilities by achieving groundbreaking results across various benchmarks, including:

- **Elementary Math Reasoning (GSM8k)**: Outperformed state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 and Claude Opus.
- **Advanced Math Problems (MATH)**: Showcased unparalleled accuracy in solving competition-level mathematics.
- **Complex Reading Comprehension (DROP)**: Set new standards in discrete reasoning over text.
- **Advanced Reasoning Challenges (BBH)**: Excelled in multi-step reasoning tasks previously unsolved by other models.
